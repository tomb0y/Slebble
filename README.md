## Build & Install
You will need to download and install the Pebble SDK that you could be found on the [Pebble developer website](https://developer.getpebble.com/sdk/install/). I also recommend follow the instructions found on the website.

### No Pebble watch needed
There is an emulator available to use within the Pebble SDK.
