## Build & Install
You will need to download and install the Pebble SDK found on the [official Pebble developer website](https://developer.getpebble.com/sdk/install/). It's also recommended that you follow the instructions found on the website.

### No Pebble watch needed (in theory)
There is an emulator available to use within the Pebble SDK, the only problem is that the config page doesn't work on emulator.

### Gulp
Before you can build the application you need to run [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Gulp installation instructions can be found [here](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md).

The most important part of the gulp execution is the [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) operation that concatinates the js files.
